FishGridCalibComedi is a simple command line program that transfers
the callibration coefficients of comedi to the fishgrid.cfg configuration file.


\section usage Usage

Let the DAQ boards run for at least 10 min to let them warm up.

Calibrate the boards (as root) by executing
\code
comedi_soft_calibrate -f /dev/comedi0
comedi_soft_calibrate -f /dev/comedi1
...
\endcode

Make sure that all configuration parameter in \c fishgrid.cfg are properly set 
(in particular the \c Maximum \c voltage and the \c Gain \c factor in the 
\c Hardware \c Settings tab).

Save your configuration file prior to calling \c fishgridcalibcomedi
\code
cp fishgrid.cg fishgrid.cfg.org
\endcode

Then start \c fishgridcalibcomedi in the directory where you also want to run \c fishgrid.
\c fishgridcalibcomedi reads options from the config file \c fishgrid.cfg in the current directory,
retrieves the calibration data for each of the comedi devices,
and writes them into the configuration file in the current directory.
