\page FishGridStepper

FishGridStepper records short sequencies of data for weakly electric
fish that are stepped through predifend positions of a raster within a
grid of electrodes.


\section usage Usage

Start \c fishgridstepper in the directory where you want to save your data (in a subdirectory).
\c fishgridstepper reads options from the config file \c ~/.fishgridstepper.cfg first
and then from \c fishgridstepper.cfg in the current directory. 
The command line options (see \c fishgridstepper --help) override the settings of the config files.
Finally, a dialog is launched that allows you to make further changes to the settings
(can be disabled by the \c -n switch).
All settings are saved back into the \c fishgridstepper.cfg file in the current directory
when quitting the program, so that on the next run you start with 
your previous settings right away.

The analog-input channels of the data-acqusition boards are assigned
to the electrodes of a single grid. The grid can span more than one daq-board.

The main widget shows the raster of positions for which to record the
fields.  The current position is the marked by the red dot, the
previous one by a yellow dot.

After activating a recording (\c Enter or \c backspace) the data are
recorded and written to disk. For the whole session, a subdirectry is created
(named by the data and time of the reocrding). For each raster position
a single raw-data file is created that is named by the column and row index.
The data from all recorded channels are multilexed as 4-byte floats into
the raw-data files.

\section keys Key shortcuts

FishGridStepper can be completely controlled by the keyboard.

- \c M : show window maximized/normalized
- \c Enter : Start recording at next raster position (that is marked red).
- \c Backspace : Redo recording at current raster position (that is marked yellow).


\section configuration Configuration
The first page of the configuration dialog defines the raster on which the fish will be moved
relatively to the grid.
The raster has a total width of \a RasterWidthX and height \a RasterWidthY. The raster nodes
are separated by \a RasterStepX and \a RasterStepY.
The origin of the raster's left lower node relative to the grids left lower electrode
is given by \a RasterOriginX and \a RasterOriginY.
%Recording starts at column \a RasterStartX and row \a RasterStartY.
The horizontal orientation of the longitudinal axis of the fish relative to the
y-axis of the grid and the raster is \a FishYaw.
Positive yaw angles indicate rotation to the left (anticlockwise).
The vertical orientation of the longitudinal axis of the fish relative to the
horizontal plane is \a FishPitch.
Positive angles indicate snout up.


\section files Files
\c fishgridstepper.cfg is the configuration file. It is read in from the directory
from which you start \c fishgridstepper. You can edit this file in a text editor
or via the startup dialog.

\c fishgridstepper saves data immediately to disc:
- \c traces-grid1-rastercc-rr.raw : the voltage traces of the grid at position \a cc (column index) and \a rr (rwo index) in Volt. In multiplexed 4 byte float numbers.
     Sampling rate and number of input channels can be obtained from \c fishgrid.cfg.
- \c fishgrid.cfg : the configuration that was used for the recording (a copy of fishgridstepper.cfg).
- \c fishgrid.log : the log messages.
- \c metadata.xml : the configuration and meta data as an odML file


\section structure Program structure

In fishgridstepper.cc is the main() function that parses the command
line options and sets up Stepper for acquiring data. Stepper inherits
ConfigData that provides options for configuring the electrode grid.
Each time a raster position is recorded,
Stepper starts an extra thread DataThread for acquisition or simulation
of data (ComediThread, NIDAQmxThread, or SimulationThread, respectively).
The Recording class manages all files that are written to disc.
