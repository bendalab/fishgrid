FishGrid acquires and analyzes recordings of 
electric fields of weakly electric fish using a grid of electrodes.


\section usage Usage

Start \c fishgrid in the directory where you want to save your data (in a subdirectory).
\c fishgrid reads options from the config file \c ~/.fishgrid.cfg first
and then from \c fishgrid.cfg in the current directory. 
The command line options override the settings of the config files.
Finally, a dialog is launched that allows you to make further changes to the settings
(can be disabled by the \c -n switch).
All settings are saved back into the \c fishgrid.cfg file in the current directory
when quitting the program, so that on the next run you start with 
your previous settings right away.

You can view the recorded input using different Analyzer modules.
Activate them by their hot keys \c I, \c T, \c P, \c E, \c R or by cycling through them with 
\c CTRL plus \c ArrowLeft or \c ArrowRight.
Most of them let you see either all electrodes (press \c A) or a single one (press \c S).
Select the electrode in either case with the arrow keys.
Ranges of the plot axis are reduced (zoom in) by pressing \c SHIFT and \c X or \c SHIFT and \c Y
for the x- and y-axis. The ranges are enlarged (zoom out) by pressing just
\c x or \c y, respectively.
Additional hotkeys for zooming are \c V for the voltage/rms/power range, 
\c F for the frequency axis of the spectra, and \c + or \c - for the time axis.

The data are continuously written into a cyclic buffer. From there they get saved into a 
file and periodically a section of this data is copied into a buffer and fed to the current
Analyzer. The Analyzer operates on the whole length of this data section, but might not show 
all of this on the plots. E.g. RMSPixel computes the RMS values on the whole data section,
Spectra computes the power spectra on the whole data section. The length of this
data section can be increased by pressing \c SHIFT \c L, and decreased by \c L.
Further options that specify how the Analyzer works can be set by launching a dialog with \c O.
How often the data section is copied from the input buffer and analyzed by the Analyzer
can be controlled by the "Interval between the data buffer updates" entry in the
startup dialog.


\section keys Key shortcuts

FishGrid can be completely controlled by the keyboard.

Plot selection:

Analysis window:
- \c L, \c + : make time window for analysis smaller by a factor 2
- \c SHIFT \c L, \c - : make time window for analysis larger by a factor 2
- \c O : launch options dialog

General:
- \c M : show window maximized/normalized


\subsection daqkeys Data acquisition

\section files Files
\c fishgrid.cfg is the configuration file. It is read in from the directory
from which you start \c fishgrid. You can edit this file in a text editor
or via the startup dialog.

When \c fishgrid saves data to disc, it writes the following 5 files:
- \c traces.raw : the voltage traces in Volt. In multiplexed 4 byte float numbers.
     Sampling rate and number of input channels can be obtained from \c fishgrid.cfg.
- \c fishgrid.cfg : the configuration that was used for the recording
- \c fishgrid.log : the log messages
- \c timestamps.dat : the timestamps. A plain text file that you can view with any text editor or \c less.
- \c metadata.xml : the configuration and meta data as an odML file


\section installation Installation

\code
./bootstrap.sh
./configure --prefix=/home/efish --with-nidaqmxbase=/usr/local/natinst/nidaqmxbase
./make
./make install
\endcode


\section structure Program structure

In fishgrid.cc is the main() function that parses the command line options
and either sets up FishGridWidget for acquiring data or BrowseDataWidget
for browsing previously recorded data. Both classes inherit BaseWidget
that provides options for configuring the electrode grid and controls
the Analyzer widgets that analyze and display the data.
The Analyzer implemented are: Idle, Traces, Spectra, RMSPlot, RMSPixel.

FishGridWidget starts an extra thread DataThread for acquisition or simulation
of data (AcquireThread or SimulationThread, respectively).
The Recording class manages all files that are written to disc during a recording.


\section ext3 Put an EXT3 filesystem on the harddrives

Login as root:
\code
su
\endcode

Run the \c fdisk program to check and change the partitions.
The USB disk should be the \c /dev/sdb device, but it might also be
 \c /dev/sdc,  \c /dev/sdd, etc.  \c /dev/sda is the internal harddrive. 
Don't touch this one! You can simply run \c dmesg. In the about 10 last lines
it writes several times \c [sdX]. Then \c /dev/sdX is your USB harddrive.
\code
fdisk /dev/sdb
\endcode
First press \c p for showing the partition table.
Then either press \c d for deleting the existing partion(s) and then \c n for
creating a new one. Or edit the existing partition type by pressing \c t and enter
\c 83 for the Linux partition type. Write the partition table back onto the 
USB harddrive by pressing \c w.

Format the first partition on the \c sdb device:
\code
mkfs.ext3 -L efish1 /dev/sdb1
\endcode
\c efish1 is the volume label.
