FishGrid acquires and analyzes recordings of 
electric fields of weakly electric fish using a grid of electrodes.


\section usage Usage

Start \c fishgrid in the directory where you want to save your data (in a subdirectory).
\c fishgrid reads options from the config file \c ~/.fishgrid.cfg first
and then from \c fishgrid.cfg in the current directory. 
The command line options (see \c fishgridstepper --help) override the settings of the config files.
Finally, a dialog is launched that allows you to make further changes to the settings
(can be disabled by the \c -n switch).
All settings are saved back into the \c fishgrid.cfg file in the current directory
when quitting the program, so that on the next run you start with 
your previous settings right away.

The analog-input channels of the data-acqusition boards are assigned
to the electrodes of upto four grids. There can be multiple grids per
daq-board and a single grid can span more than one daq-board.
Cycle through the grid with \c ALT plus \c ArrowLeft or \c ArrowRight.
or by accesing them directly by pressing \c ALT plus the number of the grid.

You can view the recorded input using different Analyzer modules.
Activate them by their hot keys \c I, \c T, \c P, \c E, \c R or by cycling through them with 
\c CTRL plus \c ArrowLeft or \c ArrowRight.
Most of them let you see either all electrodes of a grid (press \c A), a single one (press \c S),
or all electrodes of the selected grid merged into a single plot (press \c M).
Select the electrode in either case with the arrow keys.
Ranges of the plot axis are reduced (zoom in) by pressing \c SHIFT and \c X or \c SHIFT and \c Y
for the x- and y-axis. The ranges are enlarged (zoom out) by pressing just
\c x or \c y, respectively.
Additional hotkeys for zooming are \c V for the voltage/rms/power range, 
\c F for the frequency axis of the spectra, and \c + or \c - for the time axis.

The data are pre-processsed by a sequence of PreProcessor modules before
handing them to the Analyzer. In the startup dialog you can specify
which PreProcessors to use. Dialogs for setting parameters of the PreProcessers are launched by pressing
\c ALT and their hot key (\c M, \c C).

The data are continuously written into cyclic buffers.  For each grid
there is exactly one buffer. The data from the electrodes of a grid
are multiplexed into the respective buffer.  From the buffers the data
get saved into a file and periodically a section of this data is
copied into a buffer and fed to the current Analyzer. The Analyzer
operates on the whole length of this data section, but might not show
all of this on the plots. E.g. RMSPixel computes the RMS values on the
whole data section, Spectra computes the power spectra on the whole
data section. The length of this data section can be increased by
pressing \c SHIFT \c L, and decreased by \c L.  Further options that
specify how the Analyzer works can be set by launching a dialog with
\c O.  How often the data section is copied from the input buffer and
analyzed by the Analyzer can be controlled by the "Interval between
the data buffer updates" entry in the startup dialog.

\section files Files
\c fishgrid.cfg is the configuration file. It is read in from the directory
from which you start \c fishgrid. You can edit this file in a text editor
or via the startup dialog.

When \c fishgrid saves data to disc, it writes the following files:
- \c traces-gridx.raw : the voltage traces of each grid \a x in Volt. In multiplexed 4 byte float numbers.
     Sampling rate and number of input channels can be obtained from \c fishgrid.cfg.
- \c fishgrid.cfg : the configuration that was used for the recording
- \c fishgrid.log : the log messages
- \c timestamps.dat : the timestamps. A plain text file that you can view with any text editor or \c less.
- \c metadata.xml : the configuration and meta data as an odML file


\section structure Program structure

In fishgrid.cc is the main() function that parses the command line options
and either sets up FishGridWidget for acquiring data or BrowseDataWidget
for browsing previously recorded data. Both classes inherit BaseWidget
that controls the Analyzer widgets that analyze and display the data.
BaseWidget inherits ConfigData that provides options for configuring the electrode grid.
The Analyzer implemented are: Idle, Traces, Spectra, RMSPlot, RMSPixel.

FishGridWidget starts an extra thread DataThread for acquisition or simulation
of data (ComediThread, NIDAQmxThread, or SimulationThread, respectively).
The Recording class manages all files that are written to disc during a recording.
